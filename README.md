**Project Title:** STM32 UART Communication Example

**Description:**

This project provides an example of UART communication using an STM32 microcontroller. The code demonstrates how to send a message from the STM32 to an external device via UART transmission, wait for a response, and then process the received data.

**Key Features:**

- **UART Communication:** Utilizes the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface for serial communication.
- **Message Transmission:** Sends a message from the STM32 microcontroller to an external device.
- **Data Reception:** Waits for and receives data from an external device via UART.
- **Data Processing:** Extracts and processes the received data, demonstrating basic data handling techniques.
- **HAL Library Integration:** Utilizes the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) library provided by STMicroelectronics for STM32 development.

**Usage:**

1. Set up the STM32 microcontroller environment with the required toolchain and libraries.
2. Compile and flash the provided code onto the STM32 microcontroller.
3. Connect an external device compatible with UART communication to the STM32.
4. Monitor the UART communication to observe message transmission and data reception.
